This is where the app helps you. Because it allows you to warn all people who've been near you. Including people you don't know. As long as they use the app, of course.<br></br>The GGD contacts the people whose contact details you have. The app also warns people you've met, but whose name or contact details you don't know. So these people are quickly informed and able to take measures to prevent infecting others. The GGD's research continues. Because the people you've been close to more often might be at a higher risk.<br></br>You can also receive warnings through the app. If this happens, it means you've been near someone with coronavirus in last few days.
